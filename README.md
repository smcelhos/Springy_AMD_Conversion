A simple conversion of an IIFE module to AMD module(s).  The purpose of this project is simply to illustrate what differnt module patterns might look like. Springy 
<http://getspringy.org> is a cool little force directed graph layout algorithm of which I have no affiliation.  It's code was just laid out in such a way that I thought
it would be useful in illustrating what I am attempting to illustrate.
