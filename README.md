Springy AMD Conversion
=========

A simple conversion of an IIFE module to AMD module(s).  The purpose of this project is simply to illustrate what differnt module patterns might look like. Hopefully I can use it to help get some junior team members upto speed, or otherwise onboard individuals who are only familiar with legacy code.

>[Springy] is a cool little force directed graph layout algorithm of which I have no affiliation.  It's code was just laid out in such a way that I thought
it would be useful in illustrating what I am attempting to illustrate.  However, I'd suggest checking it out.

I've added additional examples, again for illustrative purposes.  This time using dojo declare.  Demonstrates how declare abstract's away some of the prototypical natural of javascript OO, making it more familiar to classical OO developers.  More code seems to look like this now a days, so seemed like a good include.
